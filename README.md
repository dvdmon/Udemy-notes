# Udemy-notes
## Some basic scripting to retrieve Udemy note content for pasting into your notes app, etc.
______________
Udemy currently has a notes function where you can created rich-text-formatted notes that are associated with individual videos for the course.  
Unforunately the display leaves something to be desired, and so I wanted to have something that would let me paste my notes to Notion, or just to a
local file that I could use to quickly review as needed.  Udemy doesn't provide any export functionality, so I thought I could do this on my own.

The script attached can be run line-by-line in the console while you have your Udemy course up on your screen with the Notes tab active.  
It works on the current course I'm in as of 11/2/2021, so it's possible this may or may not work in other courses, or if Udemy changes their markup.
